## Motivation

This repository should act as a template for any and all new 30-seconds projects (official or otherwise) that want to follow the standard format and procedures. The main reasoning behind this is that the 30-seconds movement has never been very organized or specific about templates and guidelines which, in turn, has led many developers to question the standards and guidelines for marking a repository official, while many others have found themselves needing some guidance in starting a new project.

In order to fix both issues, we provide this template repository as the essential tooling, guideline and sample kit for new projects aspiring to be part of the movement.

## Installation

1. Install [node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) **v8** or newer.
2. Clone the repository or click **Use this template** on the GitHub repository to create a new project.
3. Run `npm install`. Wait for installation to finish.
4. Allow Travis CI to access your repository, configure accordingly.
5. Create a personal access token via GitHub and add it as an environment variable to your Travis CI, named `GH_TOKEN`.
6. Configure Netlify to serve your website.
